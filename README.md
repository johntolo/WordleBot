WordleBot is a bot that aims to guess any word in the fewest tries possible. 
Wordle is a game where the goal is to guess a 5 letter mystery word by using clues from previous words you have tried.
Each guess's letters will be either green, yellow, or grey. Green means the letter is in the word and in the correct spot. Yellow means the letter is in the word but in the wrong spot. Grey means the letter is not in the word.
For example, say the word is STONE, and you guess SCENT as your first guess. The S is green, the C is grey, the E is yellow, the N is green, and the T is yellow.
In the context of my wordle bot, the word SCENT would have the combination, "gnygy" (green=g, yellow=y, grey=n)
WordleBot is designed to guess the word in the fewest attempts possible.
